# SHIFT Protocol

**SHIFT** is a proposed protocol spec for better file and directory transfers in and out of remote terminal sessions. It aims to be a better replacement for Zmodem and OSC1337 file transfers.

Read the current version of the spec at https://shift-protocol.github.io/spec/

This is currently a **draft** while gathering feedback from the community.
