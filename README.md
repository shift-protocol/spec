# SHIFT Protocol

**SHIFT** is a proposed protocol spec for better file and directory transfers in and out of remote and serial terminal sessions. It aims to be a better replacement for Zmodem and OSC1337 file transfers.

Features:

* Recursive directory transfer support.
* Transparent to Unicode processing and 7-bit channels.
* Input/output still possible when a transfer is running.
* Future extensibility baked in.
